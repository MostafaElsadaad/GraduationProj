# GraduationProj
Our Graduation was Physical Therapy Using Video Games. The project idea was that we target stroke patient who is doing a physical therapy program to improve his muscle and neurons.
We thought that we can make this physical therapy program through a game. This game simulates the physical exercise that the patient should do in the program.
We made two games: Cubes Game & Musical Fingers Game. The two games target hand exercises.
We developed these ganmes using Unity and we interface Leap Motion Module with Unity to track the hand.
